# git-website

Welcome to my public github page! I have worked on this platform before, but privately. I have decided to show all my prior and current projects I am working on using this space (sorry no PII). If you have any suggestions, please feel free to message me. The main languages I work on is Python (with all its bells and whistles), R, and SQL (if that counts)  :)

# Stay tuned for more updates!
